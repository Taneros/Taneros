Hi there! 👋 

I'm Renat 😃! I grew up hugging computers in my sleep. But only recently got very serious about becoming JS Dev 👨‍💻.

I regularly hone my coding skills 🥋 and I have this rating on Codewars:

and very soon I'll become ninja 

Here are some of my **Projects** I worked on:

- Landing site for Louvre Museum link (HTML, CSS, JS) https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/taneros-JSFEPRESCHOOL/museum/
- Browser background app  link (HTML, CSS, JS) https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/taneros-JSFE2021Q3/momentum/


Here's my full resume:
